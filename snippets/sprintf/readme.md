You might have seen things like `fmt.Println("some string")` and
variations around it. But sometimes you might want to just generate
a string using the formatting tools found under `fmt` without it
necessarily going out on `stdout`. That's what
[`fmt.Sprintf`](http://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Sprintf) is for.
